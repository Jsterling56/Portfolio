# Portfolio

This is my portfolio! 

Most of (if not all) of the work I've made is here.

This exists for the sole reason of bettering myself and my level of knowledge. Constantly learning, constantly improving.

I want to thank Rommel, Ringo, Kate, Weng, Chris, and most importantly Haley - these are the people who have helped me to get to where I am today. I could not have done it without their direct help and encouragement.
